I'm Alexander Kundert, a software engineering enthusiast currently studying with CoGrammar. Welcome to my GitHub repository!

### About Me

I'm **passionate** _about_ **coding**, problem-solving, and exploring coding and AI in software development. With a keen interest in AI and a desire to make a positive impact through software and learning to code a website, I'm on a journey to become a proficient software engineer. I have a lot to learn still, I am early in my course. 

Currently I am a chartered accountant. I am also very interested in gardening and currently sell plants on Ebay and Amazon. I am looking to use my coding knowledge to create my own website of my products and to be able to sell these direct to the public, rather than through Ebay and Amazon, hence I am looking to go self employed using my skills!

### What I'm Currently Learning

- Software Engineering fundamentals
- Coding best practices
- Building scalable and efficient applications
- Collaboration and version control with Git

### Get in Touch

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-kundert-9b489077/)) and check out some of my projects on[GitHub](https://github.com/alexkundert). I am enjoying my learning and looking to grow with others in this really interesting and complex world of coding!

#_**Happy coding!**_ ðŸš€
